[h1]Introduction[/h1]
Welcome to one of many mods that I've brought to Darkest Dungeon! If you don't know me, I'm Marvin Seo. I've helped balance Darkest Dungeon for Color of Madness' release and strive to create high quality mods that feel as if they belong in the base game. With that in mind, I want to make sure that this disclaimer is clear:

**This mod is not an official Red Hook Studios product or product modification, and Red Hook Studios Inc. is not responsible in any way for changes or damages that may result from using the mod.

[h1]Class Introduction[/h1]
A defected criminal, the Falconer specializes in disrupting the enemy team and taking advantage of her prey's weaknesses. She fires a steady and reliable volley of arrows while her falcon attacks from the skies to create opportunities for its master to finish her victims. Should she be caught in the front ranks, she is not left helpless. She can perform a hasty retreat to get back into a more favorable position, execute hit and run attacks, or catch her foes by surprise with a flanking attack or improvised stab with an arrow. The Falconer knows that every foe is different, and that she must adapt to triumph over each adversary. She can focus her fire to maim her targets, command her falcon to attack in coordination with her actions, and even hide for a more opportune time to strike. Whatever the threat, the Falconer will always be prepared.

The Falconer does not come to the Hamlet alone. Due to some past ordeal, the Falconer is hunted by members of her former group, known as Talon Brigands. Occasionally, heroes will gain a new negative Quirk called \"Marked by the Flock\". This Quirk attracts the Talon Brigands, which can randomly appear in any dungeon these heroes go to. Fighting these Brigands in bulk can yield great rewards, but be wary of bringing too many marked heroes, as you'll attract the feared leader of the Talon Brigands...

*“She did not want a life of comfort. She wanted to be respected, to be powerful, to be infamous.”*
