# (WIP) DarkestLoadOrder

DarkestLoadOrder is a mod management tool for Darkest Dungeon 1. Using .NET und WPF it offers a modern UI and easy to use drag and drop management of mods. 

While usable, the utility didn't undergo good testing or final polishing, so bugs and potentially savegame breaking issues could occur. For this reason this project has to be build individually.

# Building
1. Clone the repo
2. Restore the nuget packages
3. Build the project

# Credits
ddsavelib.dll is based on the Rust implementation of Robojumper's Save Editor, extended to be able to be used within C#: https://github.com/robojumper/DarkestDungeonSaveEditor
